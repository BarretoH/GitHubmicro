  <h3>About the Book</h3>
  <p>This book is based on the idea that there is a particular framework used 
    by economists to interpret observed reality. This framework has been called 
    the economic way of thinking, the economic approach, and the method of economics.</p>
  <p>This book is different from the many other books that attempt to teach microeconomics 
    in three ways:<br>
    &#8226; It explicitly applies the recipe of the economic approach in every 
    example.<br>
    &#8226; It uses concrete examples via Microsoft Excel in every application, 
    which enables the reader to manipulate live graphs and learn numerical methods 
    of optimization.<br>
    &#8226; The majority of 
    the content is in the Excel workbooks  which the reader uses to create meaning.</p>
  <p>You learn by doing, not by reading. <br>
